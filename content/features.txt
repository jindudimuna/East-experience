Here is how I implimented the neccesary features for this site.

◉ The Customer registration page is found in contents/signup.php. It was being sent to the database
    in line 108-122
◉ The logout feature is implemented in logout.php and it is acessed when the logout link is clicked in the navbar.
◉ The Tourist excursuon list from the database can be found in destinations.php from line 25- 34.
◉ The excursuon details page that shows the details of a selected excursion is found in view.php and is displayed by querying the data
   we passed to the url on click of a view link in destinations.php. 
◉ The booking function is in book.php and here the choices made by the user are preset except the date and comments.
◉ The booking is confirmed and sent to the databse in view.php.
◉ After a booking is made, it is viewed in the manage.php where the user can now delete it.
◉ Our sessions are created on signup.php (line 126) and used to track user login by passing it in the navbar in header.php
